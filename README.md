# Capstone - String Manipulation and Control Structures

This Python script, named "Palindrome Checker", is designed to determine if a given word or sentence is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards as forwards, ignoring punctuation, capitalization, and spaces. This script exemplifies the usage of string manipulation, loops, and control structures in Python.

## Objective:

The objectives of this project are to:

1. Gather user input of a word or a sentence.
1. Define a function:
    - `is_palindrome`: This function takes an input string and checks if it is a palindrome.
1. Use control structures to check for palindromes and print out the result.

## Code Explained:

The script executes the following steps:

- **Gather User Input**: The script begins by asking the user for a word or a sentence.
- **Define and Call Functions**: The `is_palindrome` function is defined, which checks whether the given string is a palindrome. This function utilises loops and string manipulation to compare characters at symmetrical positions in the string, ignoring non-alphabetic characters and disregarding the case. The function returns a boolean value depending on whether the input string is a palindrome.
- **Print Results**: The function is invoked with the user's input as an argument, and the result is printed in a readable format.

## Usage:

To use this script, run the Python file in your terminal and follow the prompts. You will be asked to enter a word or a sentence, and the script will determine whether or not it is a palindrome.

```
python palindrome_checker.py
```

### Note:

This script is part of a capstone project aimed at developing proficiency in string manipulation, loops, and control structures in Python. It provides a practical example of how these concepts can be used to solve problems involving string analysis and manipulation.
